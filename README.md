### What's that?

This is a sample app I've done on [Arduino Day 2014](http://day.arduino.cc/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/explore/ArduinoD14), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23arduinod14)). Totally basic app, just to try out peripherals we have been given.

### How does it work?

1. The LEDs make a red spinner in a constant pace. 
2. The potentiometer lets you control the pace of the spinner. 
3. You're happy.

**Made with love.**
